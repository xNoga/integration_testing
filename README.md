# integration_testing
This project is very small and therefore might not be the perfect example for the assignment. Integration testing should be about testing 
different modules that all have different purposes. However we are still able to reflect over which approach and method should be used for minor systems as well as reflect over what we would have done in a much larger project with actual modules.
